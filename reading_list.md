# Reading List

## Books

- [ ] "Software Architecture: Perspectives on an Emerging Discipline" by Garlan and Shaw
- [ ] "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by Erich Gamma
    - "*The classic by Gamma et al. [36] covers the design of object-oriented software and how to translate it into code presenting a collection of recurring solutions, called patterns.*" [DGL16]
- [ ] "Component Software: Beyond Object-Oriented Programming" by Clemens Szyperski
    - "*Attention to separation of concerns has recently led to the emergence of the so-called Component-based software engineering (CBSE) which has given better control over design, implementation and evolution of software systems. The last decade has seen a further shift towards the concept of service first [81] and the natural evolution to microservices afterwards*" [DGL16]
