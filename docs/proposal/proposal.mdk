# Motivation & Problem Statement { #sec-motivation }

Recently, a new software architecture style called *microservice architecture*
(MSA) emerged for designing software applications as distributed systems of
loosley coupled, independently deployable, single purpose services [@FL17].
Instead of developing monolythic applications, the application logic is split up
into a suite of small parts, each implemented as a dedicated program designed to
provide a single task of the business logic. Theses programs posing as the
applications components are called *microservices*.

The microservice architecture style is open for any programming language or
paradigm. Because the microservices are communication on a network level by
sending messages (e.g. REST, sockets, etc.), the services themselfs may be
written in different programming languages. As long as they expose the interface
required by the architecture, they are useable components [@MW16;@DGL16].

Interesting enough, this architecture style shares some similarities with long
established programming paradigms. Some examples are:

* If we use the definition given in [@DGL16] "*A microservice is a cohesive, 
  independent process interacting via messages*", we can spot commonalities with 
  object-oriented design principles: objects should be loosely coupled 
  (= independent) and highly cohesive. 
* A fundamental concept of objects is "*Clients request services from objects*". 
  In MSA, clients request services from other microservices. Using the Smalltalk 
  terminology, communication between objects happens by sending *messages* 
  (object method call) between them [@Sny93]. RESTful microservices send HTTP 
  messages.
* Simula 67 introduced the concept of objects being data structs with associated 
  operators. Additionally, two different views were introduced: the *inside view* 
  of an object - its local variables, procedures on these variables, initialising 
  operations etc. - and its *outside view*, more abstract entities representing 
  the remoteley accessible state and procedures [@Bla13]. A microservice too has 
  an internal view (the programs internal architecture, state, etc.) and an 
  outside view, the network interface it exposes (e.g REST APIs and data in JSON 
  format), consisting of more abstract entities in general.
* In the functional programming paradigm, programs are written by combining 
  functions, the so-called *function composition*. In microservice archiectures, 
  as with service-oriented architectures (SOA) in general, functionallity is 
  build by composing services [@MGZ14].

Many more conceptional resemblances can be pointed out and analysed. To get a
basic ground to work upon, we therefore ask the first research question:

> **RQ1**: Which commonalities are microservice architectures sharing with various 
  programming paradigms?

Not only can we draw connections to well-established programming paradigms. Each
microservice is a dedicated program (and therefore a system process) itself, and
each service is a component in the application architecture, so it is easy to
argue that in an MSA the components are inherently concurrent due to its
distributed nature. This also leads to some resemblences with concurrency
models. For example:

* In the *actor model*, an actor is a "*self-contained, interactive, independent 
  component of a computing system that communicates by asynchronous message 
  passing*" [@Agh90]. While in an MSA the communication can also be synchronous, 
  this definition of an actor has a striking resemblance with the definition for 
  a microservice by [@DGL16] we have already introduced. Actors have a 
  no-shared-state and immutable message philosophy, also properties of any SOA.
* The *active object pattern* allows a call of an objects method to be executed 
  in a different thread, enabling concurrent method execution of the same object. 
  This is achieved by using proxy objects on which the public methods of the active 
  objects are called [@LS95]. In a microservice architecture, when using an API 
  gateway to manage requests to the services, the gateway acts like the active 
  object proxy, dispatching or buffering the request. This is called the *proxy 
  circuit breaker pattern* [@MW16].

We see, microservice architectures do not only have commonalities with
programming paradigms, but also with models for concurrent programming.
Therefore, a close look at the concurrency principles of this architecture style
is in order. Building on the knowledge of the previous questions, we ask:

> **RQ2**: Which commonalities are microservice architecture design principles 
  sharing with concurrency models in general? Which concurrency and distributed 
  programming concepts are especially convenient for the commonalities identified 
  in RQ1?

And finally, after we have analysed the conceptual commonalities and related
concurrency concepts, we are interested in why microservice architectures are
being adapted so eagerly in the first place. We subsequently ask the question:

> **RQ3**: Do sufficiently concurrent programming languages need microservice 
  architectures?

# Expected Results { #expected-results }

The author expects that this work will result in an answer to the main research
question of "*No: sufficiently concurrent programming languages do not need
microservice architectures*". Many of the design principles are already
established in other programming language principles, first of all object
oriented design. For all of them, concurrency models have been developed and are
widely available for developers to use.  Therefore, in many of todays concurrent
programming languages, microservice architectures are only used because the
languages concurrency models and primitives make it harder for developers to
design, implement, debug and maintain - therefore ultimately *understand* - the
software architectures that serve the same design goals as the corresponding
microservice architecture does.

However, the author also expects that the only argument remaining in favour of
microservice architectures will be that todays concurrent by design programming
languages yet provide insufficient solutions for horizontal scalability through
the distribution of concurrent components (e.g. the actors in the actor model)
to multiple host machines. A microservice architecture has this property
inherently through independent service deployment. Each service (= concurrent
architecture component) is its own sophisticated program and therefore at least
a system process on the machine. This makes it possible to achieve high
scalability and parallelisation simply through distributing the microservice
processes among multiple machines.

An expected conclusion of this work will therefore be, that microservice
architectures will *not* be classified as a symptom to a problem that should
have been already solved on a programming language level (as the thesis title
might imply), but that they are merely a solution to the need for high
scalability. On the other hand, many todays software application having no
scalability problem, and yet being  developed in a microservice architecture,
are consequently a side effect. Developers grasp for easier to understand
concurrency in their architectures and micorservices inherently force them to
plan the *separation of concernces* in more detail than programming languages
usually do, resulting in an easier to understand concurrency model in their
application architectures.

# Methodology and Approach { #sec-methodology }

The methodology used to answer the given research questions outlined in ยง 
[#sec-motivation] comprises the following steps:

1. In a first round of literature review, information on both programming 
  principles as well as microservice architectures has to be gathered.
2. Based on the information base aquired in step 1, connections have to be drawn 
  between programming concepts and microservice architectures in order to identify 
  communalities and answer RQ1.
3. In the second round of literature review, information on concurrent and 
  distributed programming concepts has to be gathered and evaluated for its 
  applicability to the shared concepts identified in step 2 and in order to answer 
  RQ2.
4. Two programming languages need to be identified. Both should have sufficient 
  concurrency constructs. For one of the languages, the MSA style should be a 
  common choice of architecture, despite the languages concurrent nature. For the 
  other, at least one available concurrency approach should have a high accordance 
  to the properties identified in RQ2.
5. Based on the knowledge aquired through RQ1 and RQ2, a prototypical scenario has 
  to be identified, which is suited to be implemented using a microservice 
  architecture.
6. In both languages chosen in step 4, the identified scenario from step 5 should 
  be implemented: 
  * The implementation using the language where microservices are a common 
    architecture style should also have a MSA. The application itself will 
    therefore consist of multiple executable programs. Any microservice frameworks 
    or libraries may be used.
  * The other implementation should use only the concurrency models available to 
    the language, either as native constructs or via frameworks/libraries. The 
    applications should therefore consist of a single executable artifact.
7. Based on the prototypes developed in step 6, an answer to RQ3 should be argued.

The language choices of step 4 should depend on the knowledge aquired prior. For
example, we propose the *Go* language for its *Goroutines* and *Channels*
concurrency, and the *Erlang* language for its actor based concurrency and
natural resemblance to a microservice architecture. Both languages have cheap
concurrency primitives with small footprints.

# State of the Art { #sec-sota }

In a recent systemantic mapping study of research literature [@AAE16], is was
found that the microservice architectural style (MSA) research is currently at
an early stage, for the style was born from industrial needs, and academia has
not yet fully caught up. Subsequently, we see many of the available literature
from 2016 and early 2017. On the other hand, programming paradigm and
concurrency research has been around for decades.

As we have motivated in ยง [#sec-motivation], the microservice architecture style
has many conceptual roots in various programming paradigms (especially object-
orientation), but it also originates from service oriented architectures (SOA)
in general [@MMSL16;@MW16]. SOA can be considered the "first generation" of
services, providing benefits like dynamism, modularity, distributed development
and the integration of heterogenouse and legacy systems. Microservices can be
considered "second generation" services, and therefore and evolution of SOA,
where each service is being developed with the focus on one single functionality
of business logic, and all unnecessary levels of complexity are being
consequently removed and outsources to other dedicated services [@DGL16].

Little has been written about the interrelations in design patterns of
microservices and paradigms like object-orientation, though some have mentioned
that such exist [@DGL16;@MMSL16]. No work so far has given a comprehensive
review (cf. RQ1). Subsequently, no analysis of common concurrency concepts
exists (cf. RQ2).

This is especially interesting, for concurrency research is developing new
models aiming to solve the same or related issues through concurrent computation
as do microservices. For example, a prominent representative of the actor model,
the Erlang programming language, is currently experiencing a second spring both
in industrial use and in academic attention. In contrast to most programming
languages, an Erlang program has the main focus on the processes, rather than
objects [@Bla13]. Its was designed for key challenges like high concurrency and
availability, fault-tolerance and live-upgrades [@Vin07], similar to the needs
that lead to the microservice architecture style [@DGL16; @DLL17]. Therefore, an
idiomatic Erlang program has remarkable similarities with a microservice
architecture. Additionally, with *Distributed Erlang*, the processes can be
deployed across multiple Erlang VMs on difference host machines, incorporating
even more properties of MSA [@CLG17].

While Erlang has no focus on objects, other object-oriented approaches to
concurrency interprete objects as processes, and therefore as concurrent and
potentially parallel entities. In [@Giv14] this idea is introduced into the
`new` keyword of C++, also illustrating that other object-oriented concepts like
inheritance can be built ontop this approach.

The *OrcO* programming language, an extension of the *Orc* language, also has a
*concurrency-first* approach to objects. Unlike active objects, instead of
adding concurrency objects explicitly, each program is concurrent by default.
Sequential control structures are replaced by concurrent combinators, fields are
implicitely futures, and the object and concurrency structure are orthogonal, to
allow them to evolve separately [@PKTC16].

On the other hand, there is not only progress in concurrency evolution. The
*Jolie* programming language calls itself the first of the kind of *service-
oriented programming* paradigm [@MGZ14]. Originating in the pre-mircoservice
era, it builds upon the SOA concept of service *orchestration*, meaning the
behavioural composition of services. Jolies primary focus is the concept of the
*service*, therefore each idiomatic Jolie program defines one such. A program is
a composition of a *behaviour* and a *deployment*. The behaviour implements the
functionality of the service. However, no communication with the service is
defined inside the behaviour. This is part of the deployment, where so-called
*communication ports* regulate the access functionality the service offers (cf.
inside- and outside-view of objects mentioned in ยง [#sec-motivation]).

Jolie is a prototype language where each component is essentially a
microservice. Therefore, from a conceptual point of view, Jolie is a valuable
proof of concept that microservice principles can make their way into language
primitives of future programming languages [@MMSL16]. Subsequently Jolie has no
more explicit concurrency considerations than an MSA per se (both in language
construcs and accompaning scientic literature), therefore we think it does not
make a suitable language candidate for our experimental implementations (ยง
[#sec-methodology], item 4.).

# Relevance to the Curricula { #sec-relevance }

Both the mircoservice as well as the programming language and concurrency model
aspect of this proposal correlates well with the authors curricula *Software
Engineering & Internet Computing* and subsequently the courses he took.
Microservices were the sole content of *VU Distributed Systems Engineering*,
while the courses from the *Distributed Systems* module and others with a
software engineering focus dicussed additional topics around concepts concerning
microservice architectures.

On the other hand, the many courses of the *Computersprachen und Programmierung*
module provided deep insight in the programming paradigms needed in order to
make the intended connections of this work between microservices architectures
and concurrent programming paradigms.

Additionally, in the authors seminar works he already dicussed related topics
(multicore programming in JVM languages, as well as cloud management frameworks
- often used to manage microservice applications), providing valuable
precognition for this work.
