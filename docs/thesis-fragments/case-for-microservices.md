- good to break up large monoliths
- literature on project success, where it says that projects transforming monolith into MSA have a high success chance, while projects starting initially with an MSA tend way more to fail
- freedom to practically do whatever you want (if it works within a monolith, this particual function also works within a smaller program = MS)
